# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

Predict fraudulent bank transactions using a machine learning model.

---

## Project Highlights

- Detects fraudulent transactions with high accuracy  
- End-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and prediction  
- Deployed using render

 ### This is still an ongoing project. Since the data is imbalanced, the model is unable to catch fraud transaction.
