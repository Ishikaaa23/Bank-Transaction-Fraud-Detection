# Bank Transaction Fraud Detection

Predict fraudulent bank transactions using a machine learning model.

---

## Project Highlights

- Detects fraudulent transactions with high accuracy  
- End-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, model training, and prediction  
- Lightweight repo, model stored externally to comply with GitHub limits  

---

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for exploration and modeling  
- `src/` – Python scripts for training and prediction  
- `.gitignore` – ignores virtual environment and model files

## Model File

The trained model file `model.pkl` is too large to include in this repository.  

Download from Google Drive:  
[Download model.pkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h_lsM0_OMu2-88uSwymnxLlTDRN2Onik/view?usp=sharing)  

Place `model.pkl` in the project root.
